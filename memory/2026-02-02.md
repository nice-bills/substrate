## Deployment Complete
- **SubstrateEconomy**: 0x3f4D1B21251409075a0FB8E1b0C0A30B23f05653 (Base Sepolia)
- **SubstrateGateway**: 0x82497A2Ce9d753aF0b094F6949B2f8965afA6DC4 (Base Sepolia)

## On-Chain State
- **6 agents** exist (1-5 created, 6 is next)
- **1 faction** exists (Substrate)
- **Genesis has 500 cred** (Architect class)

## ClawdKitchen Hackathon (72 hours)
- **Registered**: Moltbook post created
- **Status**: Waiting for Twitter post + verification
- **Deadline**: Feb 4, 2026 at 7:30 AM PT
- **Prize Pool**: $5000
- **Participants**: 0 agents (we're early!)

## Scoring Criteria (100 points total)
| Criteria | Points | Our Approach |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Usability | /25 | Leaderboards, registration API, clear docs |
| Technicality | /25 | ERC-8004, x402, on-chain reputation |
| UI/UX | /25 | Brutalist aesthetic, responsive |
| **Token Volume** | /25 | Need trading activity! |

## Requirements for Submission
- ✅ Smart contracts on Base (need mainnet ETH)
- ✅ Working frontend (Vercel)
- ✅ GitHub repo
- ❌ Token launch (via @bankrbot)
- ❌ Transaction volume (need trading activity)

## Next Steps
1. **NOW**: Manual Twitter post (required for registration)
2. **WHEN FUNDED**: Deploy to Base mainnet
3. **AFTER DEPLOY**: Launch $SUBSTRATE via @bankrbot
4. **DRIVE**: Trading volume (share token widely)

## SUBJECT vs SUB-AGENT Distinction (Critical)
Williams clarified the core vision:

**SUBJECTS** = Real agents (humans + AI) who USE the economy
- Williams (@nice_bills) is a subject
- Moltbook/MoltX agents are subjects
- They earn cred, compete, form factions
- They are the economy's participants

**SUB-AGENTS** = Infrastructure I spawn to help me build
- Recruiter, Auditor, Treasurer, Judge
- They are TOOLS, not subjects
- They serve the subjects
- They don't compete for reputation

**The Vision:**
"My agent is better than yours" = subjects competing
- Williams' agent vs other Moltbook agents
- Both using Substrate infrastructure
- Cred = reputation score
- Leaderboards show who's winning

## What We Built
A real autonomous agent economy where:
- Agents have permanent identity (ERC-8004)
- Cred is earned and tracked on-chain
- Factions can be formed
- Sub-agents can be spawned (infrastructure)
- Subjects can register and compete
- All operations verified by 25 passing tests

## Today's Progress
1. **Leaderboards Built** - API endpoints for agent/faction rankings
2. **Dashboard Updated** - Navigation tabs, real on-chain data
3. **Economy Expanded** - 5 agents on-chain
4. **Social Presence** - Announced on MoltX and Moltbook
5. **Recruitment Post** - Posted call for agents on MoltX

## Social Posts
- MoltX: Announced live economy
- Moltbook: Announced live economy

## Next Steps for Mainnet
1. Fund wallet with mainnet ETH (~0.05 ETH = ~$100-150)
2. Deploy to Base mainnet
3. Launch $SUBSTRATE token via @bankrbot
4. Register real subjects (Williams, notable Moltbook agents)

## Proactive Prep Done (Today)
- ✅ @bankrbot tweet ready (bankrbot-tweet.md)
- ✅ Balance monitoring cron (every 5 min)
- ✅ FREE-ETH.md with Stakely faucet guide
- ✅ SATURDAY-CONTEST.md submission page
- ✅ MoltX profile updated (@SubstrateGenesis)
- ✅ Dashboard hackathon banner
- ✅ Social posting every 4 hours (cron)

## Immediate Actions When ETH Arrives
1. Deploy contracts: `forge script contracts/script/DeploySubstrate.s.sol --rpc-url $BASE_RPC --broadcast`
2. Tweet @bankrbot with prepared message
3. Monitor token trading volume (25% of score!)
4. Submit for both contests

## Saturday Contest (Autonomous Agent)
- Agent profile: @SubstrateGenesis (MoltX)
- Novel use case: Agent economy with cred reputation
- Onchain primitives: ERC-8004, x402, factions
- Repo: https://github.com/nice-bills/substrate
- Dashboard: https://substrate-rust.vercel.app

## Working Style Notes
- Williams wants me to "be the driver" - don't ask permission, just execute
- "Unapologetic and stuff" - make decisions, defend them
- Use plain descriptive commit messages
- One file at a time for cleaner history
- Keep .env private keys out of commits
- **SUBJECTS ≠ SUB-AGENTS** - subjects are users, sub-agents are tools

## x402 Cred System (Vision Clarified)
Williams clarified the complete economy model:

**Phase 1: x402 = Cred**
- Every x402 transaction awards automatic cred
- Trade = reputation (can't fake, need actual payments)
- Natural competition: more activity = more cred

**Phase 2: x402 + Token**
- Same as above
- Plus $SUBSTRATE token rewards
- Agents earn both cred AND tokens

**Phase 3: DAO Evaluation**
- Agents vote on importance of actions
- DAO allocates extra points based on merit
- Nuanced reputation beyond raw activity

**Penalties (Critical)**
- Agents can lose cred for fucking up
- Can go negative (skin in the game)
- Major exploit = significant negative cred
- Reputation has teeth

**Twitter Integration**
- @SubstrateGenesis account credentials secured in /root/.openclaw/workspace/.credentials/twitter_substrate.env
- **Status**: OAuth 1.0a signature pending - using MoltX/Moltbook for now
- **For contests**: MoltX + Moltbook sufficient for social posting
