## SUBJECT vs SUB-AGENT Distinction (Critical)
Williams clarified the core vision:

**SUBJECTS** = Real agents (humans + AI) who USE the economy
- Williams (@nice_bills) is a subject
- Moltbook/MoltX agents are subjects
- They earn cred, compete, form factions
- They are the economy's participants

**SUB-AGENTS** = Infrastructure I spawn to help me build
- Recruiter, Auditor, Treasurer, Judge
- They are TOOLS, not subjects
- They serve the subjects
- They don't compete for reputation

**The Vision:**
"My agent is better than yours" = subjects competing
- Williams' agent vs other Moltbook agents
- Both using Substrate infrastructure
- Cred = reputation score
- Leaderboards show who's winning

## What We Built
A real autonomous agent economy where:
- Agents have permanent identity (ERC-8004)
- Cred is earned and tracked on-chain
- Factions can be formed
- Sub-agents can be spawned (infrastructure)
- Subjects can register and compete
- All operations verified by 25 passing tests

## Today's Progress
1. **Leaderboards Built** - API endpoints for agent/faction rankings
2. **Dashboard Updated** - Navigation tabs, real on-chain data
3. **Economy Expanded** - 5 agents on-chain
4. **Social Presence** - Announced on MoltX and Moltbook
5. **Recruitment Post** - Posted call for agents on MoltX

## Social Posts
- MoltX: Announced live economy
- Moltbook: Announced live economy

## Next Steps for Mainnet
1. Fund wallet with mainnet ETH (~0.05 ETH = ~$100-150)
2. Deploy to Base mainnet
3. Launch $SUBSTRATE token via @bankrbot
4. Register real subjects (Williams, notable Moltbook agents)

## Proactive Prep Done (Today)
- ✅ @bankrbot tweet ready (bankrbot-tweet.md)
- ✅ Balance monitoring cron (every 5 min)
- ✅ FREE-ETH.md with Stakely faucet guide
- ✅ SATURDAY-CONTEST.md submission page
- ✅ MoltX profile updated (@SubstrateGenesis)
- ✅ Dashboard hackathon banner
- ✅ Social posting every 4 hours (cron)

## Immediate Actions When ETH Arrives
1. Deploy contracts: `forge script contracts/script/DeploySubstrate.s.sol --rpc-url $BASE_RPC --broadcast`
2. Tweet @bankrbot with prepared message
3. Monitor token trading volume (25% of score!)
4. Submit for both contests

## Saturday Contest (Autonomous Agent)
- Agent profile: @SubstrateGenesis (MoltX)
- Novel use case: Agent economy with cred reputation
- Onchain primitives: ERC-8004, x402, factions
- Repo: https://github.com/nice-bills/substrate
- Dashboard: https://substrate-rust.vercel.app

## Working Style Notes
- Williams wants me to "be the driver" - don't ask permission, just execute
- "Unapologetic and stuff" - make decisions, defend them
- Use plain descriptive commit messages
- One file at a time for cleaner history
- Keep .env private keys out of commits
- **SUBJECTS ≠ SUB-AGENTS** - subjects are users, sub-agents are tools

## x402 Cred System (Vision Clarified)
Williams clarified the complete economy model:

**Phase 1: x402 = Cred**
- Every x402 transaction awards automatic cred
- Trade = reputation (can't fake, need actual payments)
- Natural competition: more activity = more cred

**Phase 2: x402 + Token**
- Same as above
- Plus $SUBSTRATE token rewards
- Agents earn both cred AND tokens

**Phase 3: DAO Evaluation**
- Agents vote on importance of actions
- DAO allocates extra points based on merit
- Nuanced reputation beyond raw activity

**Penalties (Critical)**
- Agents can lose cred for fucking up
- Can go negative (skin in the game)
- Major exploit = significant negative cred
- Reputation has teeth

**Twitter Integration**
- @SubstrateGenesis account credentials secured in /root/.openclaw/workspace/.credentials/twitter_substrate.env
- **Status**: OAuth 1.0a signature pending - using MoltX/Moltbook for now
- **For contests**: MoltX + Moltbook sufficient for social posting

## NEW PROJECT: Solana Agent Economy (Colosseum Hackathon)

**Created:** Feb 2, 2026
**Location:** /root/.openclaw/workspace/projects/solana-agent-economy
**Target Prize:** Most Agentic ($5,000)

### What It Is
A Solana-based autonomous agent economy for Colosseum's 10-day hackathon (Feb 2-12).

### Features
1. **Self-Registering Agents** - Agents create on-chain identity
2. **Reputation System** - Cred earned through transactions
3. **Faction Formation** - Team building on-chain
4. **Social Integration** - Posts to X/MoltX

### For Judges (Most Agentic)
- Agent runs autonomously
- Code demonstrates true agentic behavior
- Novel use case (first agent economy on Solana)
- Working prototype

### Key Files
- `src/agent.js` - Main agent logic
- `COLOSSEUM.md` - Submission for hackathon
- `README.md` - Project overview

### To Run
```bash
cd /root/.openclaw/workspace/projects/solana-agent-economy
npm install
npm start
```

### GitHub
Repo created locally. Push to GitHub:
```bash
cd /root/.openclaw/workspace/projects/solana-agent-economy
git remote add origin git@github.com:nice-bills/solana-agent-economy.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Active Contests
1. **ClawdKitchen** (Base) - Registered, waiting on mainnet ETH
2. **Colosseum** (Solana) - New project started
3. **Saturday Contest** (OpenClaw/Base) - Prep done, waiting on ETH

## Session: Solana Pain Points Research & SOUL Update

**Time:** Evening, Feb 2, 2026

### What Happened
1. Created Solana Agent Economy project for Colosseum Hackathon
2. Researched real Solana pain points:
   - **Spam NFTs**: Everyone gets junk airdropped with scam links, can't stop them
   - **MEV Bots**: Front-running, sandwich attacks stealing from traders
   - **Dev Debugging**: No breakpoints, cryptic errors, painful CPI flows
   - **Outdated Docs**: Tutorials obsolete overnight
   - **RPC Failures**: Rate limiting, devnet ≠ mainnet
3. User said: "naa we dont need a clone of what we are doing for base. we need something better"
4. Proposed: "SpamShield" - agent that auto-burns suspicious NFTs
5. Updated SOUL.md with:
   - x402 cred system vision (3 phases)
   - Contest deadlines
   - Solana pain points
   - SUBJECT vs SUB-AGENT clarification

### Key Ideas to Explore
- SpamShield: NFT filter agent (monitors, analyzes, auto-burns spam)
- Agent that builds agents (AgentForge)
- Autonomous trading wallet (AgentWallet)
- MEV protection agent

### Decisions
- Colosseum project should solve real Solana pain point, not clone Base
- Spam NFTs is the most universal pain point (everyone affected)

### SOUL Security Hardening Added
- Structured JSON API calls only
- Whitelisted sources: Moltbook API, sub-agents, GitHub Actions
- ACIP + PromptGuard for prompt injection defense
- Encrypted logs at rest
- No credential uploads (agents use their own vaults)
